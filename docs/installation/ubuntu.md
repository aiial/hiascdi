# Introduction
This installation guide provides a step by step guide that takes you through the installation process for the **HIASCDI**.

&nbsp;

# Prerequisites
For this project you will need to ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and running.

## HIAS Core

**HIASCDI** is a core component of the [HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-Core). Before beginning this tutorial you should complete the HIAS installation guide and have your HIAS server online.

&nbsp;

# Operating System
The **HIASCDI** supports the following operating system(s):

- Ubuntu 18.04

&nbsp;

# Installation
You are now ready to install the **HIASCDI** software.

## Clone the repository

Clone the [**HIASCDI**](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-TassAI-Facial-Recognition-Agent " **HIASCDI**") repository from the [Asociación de Investigacion en Inteligencia Artificial Para la Leucemia Peter Moss](https://github.com/AIIAL "Asociación de Investigacion en Inteligencia Artificial Para la Leucemia Peter Moss") Github Organization.

To clone the repository and install the project, make sure you have Git installed. Now navigate to your HIAS installation project root and then use the following command.

``` bash
 git clone https://github.com/AIIAL/HIASCDI.git
 mv HIASCDI components/hiascdi/
```

This will clone the **HIASCDI** repository and move the cloned repository to the components directory in the HIAS project (components/hiascdi/).

``` bash
 cd components/
 ls
```

Using the ls command in your HIAS project root directory should show you the following.

```
 hiascdi
```

Navigate to the **HIAS/components/hiascdi/** directory in your HIAS project root, this is your project root directory for this tutorial.
